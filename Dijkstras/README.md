# Dijkstra's Algorithm
This project contains a method within the AdjacencyList class that implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to print all of the minimum distance paths from the source vertex to all other vertices within the AdjacencyList.

In the future I would like to clean up and resolve the issue where choosing a source vertex other than the "first" vertex within the AdjacencyList does not always output the correct minimum paths to all vertices.
