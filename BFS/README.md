# Breadth First Search
This assignment contains the implementation of Breadth First Traversal of an AdjacencyList.
To achieve this I utilized a LinkedList as a queue and instantiated a new ArrayList to hold the values in the order they should be printed.
I continued this while the LinkedList queue wasn't empty. 
Anytime a destination vertex had not been visited, I would add that vertex to the queue.
